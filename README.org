#+TITLE: Consult LSP-mode integration

*This is very much WIP*

The main command that makes LSP-mode better than eglot for me is the ability to
see all the errors in one, or all workspaces. Since I use consult, let's try to
mimic a few features of [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/helm-lsp][helm-lsp]] in consult/selectrum workflow

* Commands
- consult-lsp-diagnostics :: Select diagnostics from workspace
